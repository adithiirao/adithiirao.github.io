&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 100 living mammalian species depend on the ocean for most, if not all of their needs. A recurrent theme in the evolution of tetrapods is the return to an aquatic habitat. While amphibians never completely parted with the water, most other tetrapod groups have various representatives that are seen to have returned to the water, to some degree. Extant marine mammals include a diverse cohort of species, that have representatives in three broad orders. The order Carnivora contains the Pinnipeds (sea lions, walruses and seals), sea otters and polar bears. The order Cetacea includes animals such as whales, porpoises and dolphins, and finally the order Sirenia consists of sea cows like manatees and dugongs. Extinct marine mammals were no less diverse, including hippopotamus-resembling desmostylians, the strange bear-like carnivore Kolponomos, and even aquatic sloths like Thalassocnus &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281874441_Marine_Mammals_Evolutionary_Biology_Third_Edition&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being so taxonomically diverse, all three groups of mammals are influenced and unified in some way by the ocean &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Marine+Mammal+Biology%3A+An+Evolutionary+Approach-p-9781444311334&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;. Because the unification is so large and so drastic, it is extremely useful to study the similarities and differences among these various marine mammal groups, that have so seamlessly adapted to life in the water. Their skin changed for an increased amount of insulation (through acquiring blubber/fur), as the temperature dipped. In addition, their ears, nose and limbs have also changed, to give them the ability to not only swim, but also comfortably exist underwater. Among sensory adaptations, the most discussed is the high frequency sound used by whales, for echolocation. The other groups of marine mammals have been able to develop an acute sense of smell, sensitive nerve fiber whiskers that they utilize as tactile organs, and even heavily lobulated kidneys, to cope with the high salt concentration in the water &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281874441_Marine_Mammals_Evolutionary_Biology_Third_Edition&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;! These are just a few of the many, many fascinating changes that these organisms underwent while transitioning from land to water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While sirenians and pinnipeds have also undergone morphological, developmental and functional changes, we can see that the mechanisms through which these changes occurred, are significantly different. Besides, an important challenge in marine mammal studies, as well as in the process of science in general, is the lack of ancient data. Unearthing new cetacean data has opened a multitude of doors in marine mammal studies, but one must be careful not to make too many generalizations in extrapolating cetacean data to the other two marine mammal groups &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3198&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;. Cetaceans, pinnipeds and sirenians have undergone independent adaptation events and evolved very similar physiological features and body plans. The molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying many of these key adaptations have been receiving lots of attention, and yet are vastly unknown &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1186/s12862-016-0682-4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;. Nonetheless, there are several studies and researchers who have acknowledged that the first step to discovering these mechanisms, is finding the precise relationship between these animals. For this reason, I felt it was pivotal to attempt to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree of my groups of interest, and perform an inference and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, systematics is a great area to explore since one can not only use it to understand evolutionary contexts, but also how organisms change over time, the direction of the changes and the frequency with which the changes transpire. It also makes it much easier to compare the descendants of one common ancestor and look for patterns of origin, which is what I am interested in. Though phylogenetic studies in the literature are quite common &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3198&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.96.18.10261&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-8-216&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;, studies that combine all three marine mammal groups and their terrestrial relatives are few. To map out this relationship, I performed a phylogenetic reconstruction of the extant marine mammal lineages, along with their land- living counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build the tree, I chose 27 species of marine mammals; I made sure to have a representative set of species, evenly distributed over all three groups. For cetaceans, I used 7 species, for sirenians, 4, and for pinnipeds, I used 6 – I made sure to include individuals from a variety of families. I also chose their corresponding related terrestrial animals (Table 1), based on existing literature &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Marine+Mammal+Biology%3A+An+Evolutionary+Approach-p-9781444311334&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;. I obtained the gene sequences for all 27 marine species as well as my out-group, from GenBank, and downloaded it in FASTA format. The phylogenetic analysis was performed based on between 400 and 1500 base pairs (bp) of mitochondrial DNA, cytochrome b gene sequence data, for all 28 individuals in the tree (including the out-group).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;center-block&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/Marine_T1.png&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mitochondrial DNA is extremely widely used as a marker in ancient DNA studies, especially for marine mammals. Since every cell contains thousands of copies of the mitochondrial genome (as opposed to one copy of the nuclear genome), amplification potential through polymeric chain reaction is greatly increased. Mitochondrial DNA also evolves under neutrality, and is often used to make demographic inferences. In neutrally evolving markers, the diversity is expected to be directly proportional to the effective population size, so changes in diversity are usually inferred to reflect demographic changes &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3198&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the marine species, one out-group was chosen – &lt;em&gt;Ornithorhynchus anatinus&lt;/em&gt; (Platypus) – to note the relative positions of the other 27 species. Numerous marine mammal studies in the past &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3198&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; have used the platypus and similar species as an out-group. Further, I felt that this species was quite distant from the in-group, while still being adequately related – this took some trial and error. The out-group also needed to be rooted manually, which might be of interest to know. The out-group not rooting automatically is quite normal, and often has to do with a lack of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build a phylogenetic tree, I used the software MEGAX (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis). MEGAX offers a variety of different options and customizations, so that one can choose the methods that are most fitting for their respective project. After downloading the FASTA sequences, I needed to align them. For the alignment step, I decided to go with the DNA Muscle alignment option. This made sense to do, since this method can generate multiple alignments of amino acids and nucleotide sequences. It also has a very high speed and accuracy level, in comparison to MAFFT, CLUSTALW, and other available alignment options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of the type of tree I wanted to build, the choice was Maximum Likelihood Estimation. This method helps by providing the probabilities of the sequences, given their evolution, on a particular constructed tree. By this logic, the more probable the sequences, the more the tree is preferred. It aims to find the tree that gives you the highest probability of the observed characteristics; it is a very robust and commonly used method, even in the existing marine mammal literature. This choice also allows one to infer the branch length (the time axis), which we would be unable to do with other methods like Maximum Parsimony, which would just provide the topology without any temporal information. Though I did find the branch lengths in my analysis, I have left them out of this report since the focus here is on the relationships between species, as opposed to the timeline of divergence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model I used was the General Time Reversible Model; the genome itself is not a monolith, and I felt that this method was best suited, with my limited understanding of it, as well as past literature. Not all positions of the genome evolve at the same rate, so for the rates among sites, Gamma Distributed with Invariant Sites (G + I) was chosen. The logic behind choosing this model was that not all sites would mutate, but the ones that do, correspond to a gamma distribution. The heuristic method chosen was the default setting – nearest neighbour interchange (NNI) – as were all other options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making these choices, I bootstrapped my tree with a value of 500. This is a very important step to ensure that the resulting tree is computationally robust, especially when constructing trees with not many species and not enough sequences and/or base pairs. This bootstrapping process produces a value at each node, which indicates what percentage of times the same branch was observed in the same location, each time the tree was reconstructed in every subsequent iteration (i.e., the percentage of times the same nodal relationship was recovered). Essentially, it assesses the confidence associated with each node or speciation event in the observed tree, and depicts the one final consensus tree that is most likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;inferences-and-discussion&quot;&gt;Inferences and Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phylogenetic trees like this one (Figure 2), help us gauge the evolutionary relationship among species or other entities that are assumed to have a common ancestor. In these trees, each node, which is a taxonomic unit, represents the most recent common ancestor of its descendants. A relatively high amount of sequences analysed (400 – 1500 bp), the use of the maximum likelihood method, and even the introduction of the gamma parameter in the analysis, resulted in the phylogenetic tree shown in Figure 2. Because the method used here is Maximum Likelihood, the simplifying assumption made is that the species evolve independently, once initially diverged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One systematic way of analysing this tree, would be to examine each group individually. Cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises), are at the very bottom of the tree (Box A, Figure 2). We can see that their relative relationships are quite strong, since all the whales, porpoises and dolphins are part of the same clade. However, though their closest terrestrial relatives are thought to be artiodactyls like cattle and deer, the relationship is not reflected in the tree. Instead, these terrestrial mammals are a part of the above clade, with the pinnipeds and sirenians (Box B, Figure 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;float-right&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid rounded&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/Marine_F2.png&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sirenians (manatees and dugongs) are also adequately represented in the tree, since they are all not only adjacent to one another in the same clade, but also have very high bootstrap numbers. Additionally, their closest living relatives are rock hyraxes and elephants. While the tree shows an impressively high confidence for their association with hyraxes (Box C, Figure 2), the elephant seems to be placed quite far away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the pinnipeds (sea lions, seals, walruses) are at the very top of the tree. Other than the walrus, they are all shown to be part of the same clade, and rightly so, as more concrete studies have shown. They are not only in the same clade as each other, but also as their terrestrial relatives – skunks and otters (Box D, Figure 2). However, brown bears, walruses and polecats, though together, are in the cetacean clade, below. Unsurprisingly, the bootstrap value of this clade is a mere 8, so it is definitely not a very likely relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On examining the tree, it is clear that there are quite a few discrepancies. I felt it would be more useful to use the tree I got with the available data and explain the visible discrepancies, as opposed to attempt to create the “perfect” tree. For one, it seems that a lot of nodes have bootstrap values much lower than 100. This could be due to multiple plausible reasons. Firstly, insufficient data – between 400 and 1500 bp of nucleotides were used, which might not be sufficient for a group that is this genetically similar. Another reason for some clades having low bootstrap values could potentially be because more than one clade was equally distant from other groups, so the software was not able to assign numbers effectively. It is also possible that a low bootstrap value means that those species do not actually belong together in the same clade, which is definitely true in this case (since similar trees have already been built and are known to be true &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0602920103&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;). We can also see that the out-group does not have an associated bootstrap value at all; this is because it was manually rooted by force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A critical concept while constructing phylogenetic trees, especially in a study of this nature, is homology. Homology is essentially a similarity in traits, owing to a shared ancestor. Two features are characteristically homologous, if the last common ancestor possessed it. For instance, the flippers possessed by seals and sea lions are homologous, since we can see that they shared a very recent common ancestor, which also possessed flippers (Point 1, Figure 2). Homoplasy, on the other hand, is the opposite; the flippers possessed by a seal and by a whale are homoplasious, since their last common ancestor (which is far behind, since they are quite distantly related) lacked them (Point 2, Figure 2). Homoplasy comes about in two distinct ways; one, independent evolution of the same features (convergence) or two, reversal, loss of the derived feature, with the re-establishment of the ancestral feature, a second time. Through fossil evidence and gene sequencing, we know that in the case of cetaceans and pinnipeds, the former theory holds true – their flippers evolved completely independently, and their similarities are homoplasious by convergent evolution  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281874441_Marine_Mammals_Evolutionary_Biology_Third_Edition&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1002/ar.20545&quot;&gt;[10]&lt;/a&gt;. Over the past few decades, it has become quite well established that marine mammals are crucial biological models, especially in the study of convergent evolution and aquatic adaptations. Despite coming from very different ancestors, all three groups of mammals have adapted to life in similar habitats – they independently recolonized the aquatic environment &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1186/s12862-016-0682-4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there are a multitude of genomic routes to reach the same phenotype and morphological outcome, it has been suggested that convergent evolution often causes genomic changes to be reproducible, meaning that convergent phenotypic traits may commonly occur due to the same genetic modifications. In fact, convergence in phenotypes has been linked to identical replacements of single amino acids within the encoded product of a gene, independently in unrelated taxa. Studies in the past have explored this, and found that convergent amino acid substitutions are indeed widespread throughout the genome, and a subset of these substitutions are in genes associated with the marine phenotype, evolving under positive selection. Parallel changes seen in coding genes mapping to the same amino acid site in more than one marine mammal lineage were also found to be widespread in the genome &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3198&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;. The only way to properly discern and compare these findings in each lineage, is through a holistic approach – a good way to understand this, is through an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest focus in marine mammal evolution has always been skeletal adaptations, as well as hind-limb loss. I addressed cetacean hind-limb loss in my presentation for Milestone 1 (allowing us to come full circle!); however, that was from a single perspective. In reality, it can be studied holistically, from multiple perspectives – paleontological, developmental and even functional. From a paleontological perspective, hind-limb reduction and loss has been greatly documented, and each specific morphological stage can be clearly linked to different locomotor modes. While early cetaceans like Pakicetus had large feet that they used for movement in the water, later cetaceans developed long and muscular tails for propulsion; over time, their hind- limbs because rudimentary. From a functional perspective, studies show that the loss of hind- limbs aided in streamlining the body; otters, for example, are great examples of functional models for the different evolutionary stages of marine mammal evolution. Essentially, hind- limb reduction led to more efficient swimming, and selection for loss of hind-limbs must have been strong, especially in the presence of predators &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0602920103&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;float-right&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid rounded&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/Marine_F3.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a developmental perspective too, hind- limb loss has been studied extensively; yet, many mechanisms still remain unknown. Nonetheless, there are some parallels that can be drawn to studies performed on other tetrapods. We know that in amniote embryos, there are two signaling centers that control limb growth – the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) and the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA). In amniotes, Fgf4, 8, 9 and 17 mediate signaling activity of the AER. The ZPA, on the other hand, is characterized by the expression of Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Shh in turn, is partly regulated by a transcription factor called Hand2 &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0602920103&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mice, chicks and other tetrapods, Hand2 is initially expressed throughout the limb, and is later limited to the posterior edge of the limb buds, where Shh is continually needed. For marine mammals that have lost their hind- limbs, though, Thewissen et al. found that there is a deviation from this regular mechanism. It was found that these animals display a hind- limb bud with a distinct AER around Carnegie 13 stage (standardized 23 stage development chronology), which is lost by Carnegie 15 (Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After AER loss, consequently the hind-limb bud also reduces in size, and nearly disappears. Since the AER is initially present, the degeneration of it is probably not the primary reason behind the absence of the hind-limbs. Instead, it may just reflect an underlying deficiency in cell signaling, perhaps in the ZPA. In fact, it was found that the real source of the change was the upstream regulator of Shh, Hand2. Hand2 is present in the forelimb region, but undetectable in the area of the developing hind-limb; this may be the underlying reason for the failure of ZPA establishment and hind-limb formation &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0602920103&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though one write-up is not enough to do justice to a topic like this one, it is extremely fascinating to try and understand the changes these animals underwent at various levels, to become what they are today. The water did act as a new niche for these animals, but in doing so, it had so many other implications, leading to the emergence of completely different species – morphologically and otherwise. Despite the advances in understanding marine mammals (especially cetaceans), it remains unclear which processes caused this pattern of land-to-water transition: Why did so many lineages enter the oceans? Was it to discover new food sources, for refuge from danger, or even to deal with their own weight &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1007/s12052-009-0135-2&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though a multitude of questions remain unanswered, the rich fossil record, new molecular tools and research workflows, can now aid and enrich several subfields of molecular and evolutionary science, including developmental biology, comparative anatomy and molecular systematics &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1007/s12052-009-0135-2&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;. As these processes grow deeper, the hope is that they will eventually allow one to answer the above numerous questions, and finally determine the phenomena that drove marine mammals back into the water – a niche they spent millennia trying to escape in the first place!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Introduction</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Shade Avoidance Syndrome - Do Plants Learn from Light?</title><link href="/blog/2021/Shade-Avoidance/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Shade Avoidance Syndrome - Do Plants Learn from Light?" /><published>2021-06-27T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-06-27T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/blog/2021/Shade-Avoidance</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2021/Shade-Avoidance/">&lt;p&gt;Competition for light is something that is often seen in plants, as light is a major limiting factor. In dense herbaceous forest communities, it is unreliable to depend on the erratic and patchy sunlight – this is especially true for understorey plants, because they are characteristically sheltered by the canopy. But yet, understorey plants exist – how? To overcome the aforementioned problem, plants have evolved a variety of different approaches to not only survive, but also thrive, in different light conditions. One of those ways is by avoiding or tolerating shade. Angiosperms, for instance, display an impressive array of shade-avoidance tactics, which is definitely one of the factors associated with their immense success &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3040.1997.d01-104.x&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plants perceive light with their photoreceptors, which are essentially made of proteins (phytochromes) linked to chromophores, the part of the molecule that is responsible for colour. Phytochrome responds to two areas of the light spectrum – red wavelengths (~667nm) and far-red wavelengths (~730nm) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indefenseofplants.com/blog/2017/7/8/how-plants-perceive-light&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;. Phytochromes are also present in two forms: there is \(\text{P}_{\text{r}}\) (the inactive form) and \(\text{P}_{\text{fr}}\) (the active form), which undergo interconversion, changing the shape of the chromophore. Red light converts \(\text{P}_{\text{r}}\) to \(\text{P}_{\text{fr}}\), which then goes on to trigger and induce genes. This fact allows us to tell whether the phytochrome is in its active or inactive form, depending on the ratio of far-red to red light reflecting off of/through leaves. If plants were exposed to red light, \(\text{P}_{\text{r}}\) would be converted to \(\text{P}_{\text{fr}}\), and the plant would absorb the red light quite strongly, with a peak around 650nm. However, once the red photons are absorbed, the pigment undergoes a conformational change to the \(\text{P}_{\text{fr}}\) state. In this state, far-red light is absorbed more efficiently than red light, and there is a shift in peak absorbance (to about 720nm).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shade avoidance responses are initiated by an environmental signal – the reduction of the red (R) to far-red (FR) radiation ratio. This tends to happen in crowded plant communities where every individual’s exposure to light is not uniform, since vegetation dramatically alters the spectral energy distribution of daylight &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1093/aob/mci165&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;. Because of the sheer number of neighbours the amount of far-red and red light differs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their natural environments, plants show aggressive shade-avoidance. In response to low R:FR signals, many plant species rapidly increase their stem elongation growth rate (longer internodes and petioles), often, but not always, at the expense of leaves and other storage organs. Leaves tend to thin and reorient upwards at elevated angles (hyponasty), branching is reduced, and tendrils and other organs that are capable of longitudinal growth also show responses to this low R:FR. These responses to low R:FR is what is described by ‘syndrome’ – multiple symptoms caused by an underlying problem. If the shade persists and the plant is unable to out-compete other vegetation, flowering is accelerated, to speed up fertilization and ensure reproductive success &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1093/aob/mci165&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using these shade-avoidance tactics, the plant is able to increase its chances of survival. Elevating the leaves and other photosynthesizing structures to unfiltered daylight is therefore proving to be an effective strategy in rapidly growing plant populations &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1093/aob/mci165&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Competition for light is something that is often seen in plants, as light is a major limiting factor.

Angiosperms, for instance, display an impressive array of shade-avoidance tactics, which is definitely one of the factors associated with their immense success [1].</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">An Analysis of Butterfly Phylogenetics in Mollem National Park, India</title><link href="/blog/2021/Mollem/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="An Analysis of Butterfly Phylogenetics in Mollem National Park, India" /><published>2021-06-02T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-06-02T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/blog/2021/Mollem</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2021/Mollem/">&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of the recent clearance approval for Mollem National Park and Bhagwan Mahaveer Wildlife Sanctuary in Goa for infrastructural projects, the issue of biodiversity loss has become much more real. The Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary is Goa’s largest protected area that falls in the Western Ghats. Located near Mollem, it is about 60km south-east of the Panaji district in Goa. It is one of the 36 biodiversity hotspots and was also recently declared a natural World Heritage Site. In addition to this, it is an important tiger corridor between Goa and the Kali Tiger Reserve, in Karnataka.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infrastructural projects such as track laying and instalment of high tension wires, especially on rugged terrain, will cause a lot of damage and disturbance in this biologically important area. The approval of projects like this, requires site inspection and study, especially in the wake of climate change, which was allegedly not done &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/news/protests-goa-infra-projects-protected-area&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. These ghats are such an old range, full of endemic species and heritage houses that are found exclusively there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, we felt it was pertinent to compute the phylogenetic diversity in these areas being destructed, and in a way, see what will be lost. While the effects of climate change are countless, one that is not being recognized enough, despite its importance, is biodiversity loss. These fast paced changes in climatic and environmental conditions are posing a large challenge to a multitude of organisms, and are making it extremely difficult for them to adapt and keep up with the changes around them. There are a large number of mammals, amphibians and reptiles, birds and butterflies in this geographic area, but this report will only deal with butterflies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason I chose this group (butterflies) to study, was because they are excellent indicator organisms for biodiversity studies &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1007/bf02703397&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;. They are common in most places and also easy to observe for a study of this nature. It is comparatively easier to reliably identify butterflies, both common and rare, making the data more promising. Further, since many species of caterpillars have very strict dependence on certain host flora, their diversity and community composition are dependent on the plants found in that area. They also metamorphosize, and contribute to local diversity extensively, due to their dual functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From pre-existing literature &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1007/bf02703397&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;, we know that the Western Ghats as a whole, has butterfly fauna comprising 330 species, across 166 genera and 5 families. The goal was to construct a phylogenetic tree of the ~140 species at Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary and Mollem National Park, in hopes to increase awareness and examine the potential damage that a project like this, can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methods&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary and Mollem National Park spans about 240 square kilometres, in the Western Ghats. Its butterfly diversity includes an estimated 143 species, including dozens of endemic species, as well. I documented the species of butterflies present here from the India Biodiversity Portal, which is an open-access repository of information on India’s biodiversity. Through this, I was able to find adequate sequences for 102 out of the 127 species listed on the checklist &lt;a href=&quot;https://indiabiodiversity.org/checklist/show/228&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;. The gene sequences for each of the 102 species, as well as my out-groups, were obtained from GenBank &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; and downloaded in Fasta format.. The phylogenetic analyses was performed based on between 650 and 1000bp of mitochondrial DNA, cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene sequence data, for all individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three out-groups from two genera were chosen – &lt;em&gt;Apis cerana indica&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Paragomphus genei&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Paragomphus fritillarius&lt;/em&gt; – to note their relative positions, from the other 102 species. Numerous butterfly phylogenetic studies &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1007/bf02703397&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt; in the past have used similar out- groups, and I felt that they were quite distant from the in-group, while still being adequately related – this took some trial and error. The out-group also needed to be rooted manually. It is important to note that since I had three out-groups and the software only allows you to root one, I re-made a tree with only &lt;em&gt;Apis indica&lt;/em&gt; as the out-group, for my phylogenetic diversity calculation (excluded the two &lt;em&gt;Paragomphus&lt;/em&gt; species).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To quantify the butterfly diversity in Mollem National Park and Bhagwan Mahaveer Wildlife sanctuary, I used the software MEGAX (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis), to build a phylogenetic tree, and R packages ape, caper, picante and phytools, to calculate phylogenetic diversity. MEGAX offers a variety of different settings, so that one can choose what is most fitting for their respective project. For alignment, I decided to go with the DNA Muscle alignment option. This made sense to do, since it can generate multiple alignments of amino acids and nucleotide sequences. It has a very high speed, in comparison to MAFFT, CLUSTALW, and other such options, and has the highest rank in accuracy, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of phylogenetic tree building, the choice was Maximum Likelihood Estimation. It helps provide the probabilities of the sequences, given their evolution on a particular tree. By this logic, the more probable the sequences, the more the tree is preferred. It aims to find the tree that gives you the highest probability of the observed characteristics; it is a very robust and commonly used method. This choice also allows us to infer the branch length (the time axis), which we would be unable to do with other methods like Maximum Parsimony, which would just provide the topology without any temporal information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model I used, was the General Time Reversible Model; the genome itself is not a monolith, and I felt that this method was best suited, with my limited understanding of it, and classroom discussions. Next, for the rates among sites, because not all positions of the genome evolve at the same rate, Gamma Distributed with Invariant Sites (G + I) was selected. The logic behind choosing this is that not all sites would mutate, but the ones that do, correspond to a gamma distribution. The heuristic method chosen was the default setting – nearest neighbour interchange (NNI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making these choices, I bootstrapped it, with a value of 500. This is a very important step, especially when constructing trees with not many species and not enough sequences or base pairs, for it to be computationally robust. This process gives you a value, which indicates what percentage of times, the same branch was observed in the same location, every time the tree was reconstructed in each subsequent iteration (or the same nodal relationship was recovered). In a way, it assesses confidence associated with the observed tree, at each node (or speciation event), and depicts one consensus tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;inferences-and-discussion&quot;&gt;Inferences and Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;float-left&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid rounded&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/Mollem_F1.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phylogenetic trees like this one (Figure 1), help one gauge the evolutionary relationship among species or other entities, that are assumed to have a common ancestor. In these trees, each node, which is a taxonomic unit, represents the most recent common ancestor of its descendants. A relatively high amount of sequences analysed (650 – 1200 bp), the use of a maximum likelihood method, and even introduction of the gamma parameter in the analysis, resulted in the phylogenetic tree shown in Figure 1. Because the method used here is Maximum Likelihood, the simplifying assumption made is that once diverged, the species evolve independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tree was the outcome of the 500 replicate bootstrap performed, and it had the highest log likelihood value of -25696.79. Of course, this value cannot be used in isolation as an index of fit, because it is a function of sample size. However, it can be used in comparison of different coefficients and factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tree, the node preceding &lt;em&gt;Zizina otis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Zizeeria lysimon&lt;/em&gt; (Figure 1, Box A) has diverged, hence they share a more recent common ancestor with each other, than either shares with any other tip in the tree. Therefore, they are also more closely related to each other than to any of the other tips. However, every other tip is equally related to both &lt;em&gt;Zizina otis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Zizeeria lysimon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of the oldest lineage, it is clear that the clade consisting of &lt;em&gt;Tagiades gana&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cethosia nietneri&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Graphium Agamemnon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Papilio polytes&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Graphium sarpedoon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Chilades pandava&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Eurema blanda&lt;/em&gt; (Figure 1, Box E), is the oldest. This explains why is it the very last clade on this tree. Further proof of this is seen when the branch lengths are noted (as opposed to just topology), where this length corresponds to time (Figure 2). Here too, we see that this clade has the longest branch length, and hence is the oldest lineage. By the same logic as the above conclusion, the divergence event separated the lineage that gave rise to this oldest clade, from the lineage that gave rise to all the other tips in this tree (that is, &lt;em&gt;Vindula erota&lt;/em&gt; and above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phylogenetic diversity (PD) value was also calculated, using the pd.calc() function in R. For the purpose of this, another tree was used, with only &lt;em&gt;Apis cerana indica&lt;/em&gt; as the out-group. The two &lt;em&gt;Paragomphus&lt;/em&gt; species were removed, as only one out-group could be rooted in this software. This resulted in a total of 102 species, excluding the out-groups. The value obtained was 118.97, which is arbitrary by itself. Since PD is not a fundamental biological unit, it cannot be analysed in isolation. This value is only of use when compared with others. For example, a similar phylogenetic tree for the 33 mammals of Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary, yielded a PD value of 10.19. So from this we can say that the phylogenetic diversity is higher for butterflies, than it is for mammals. This also seems to be correlated to the number of species considered, which makes sense, since more species, especially if spanning multiple genera, would mean more diversity. It also seems to vary with bootstrap number – two other individuals with similar butterfly trees, got PD values of 125.1485 and 182.0359. The value of this tree, too, changed from 118.97 to 231.5219, when bootstrap number was reduced, which is strange. It could point to a lack computational robustness, or just a lack of enough data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;float-right&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid rounded&quot; src=&quot;/assets/img/Mollem_F2.png&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On looking at the generated tree in Figure 1, we can see a few discrepancies. For one, it seems that a lot of nodes have values much lower than 100 and some don’t seem to have an associated value at all. This could be due to multiple reasons. One, insufficient data – between 650 and 1200 bp of nucleotides were used, which might not be sufficient for a group that is significantly genetically similar. We can also see that out-group 1 (Figure 1) does not have an associated value; this is because it was manually rooted by force. Another reason for some clades having no bootstrap values could be potentially because more than one clade was equally distant from other groups, so the software was not able to assign numbers effectively. It is also possible that a low bootstrap value means that those species do not belong together in the same clade, for example, Figure 1, Box B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also strange that the monophyletic &lt;em&gt;Paragomphus&lt;/em&gt; out-groups (Figure 1, out-groups 2a, 2b) are depicted as a part of the in-group, despite being quite distantly related to butterflies. This could again be due to the fact that there was not enough data used to build the tree. It could again also be a lack of computational robustness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are multiple clades wherein the bootstrap values are really low for example, Box B in Figure 1. However, in contrast, Box C and D show relatively high bootstrap values, which shows that it is likely that they belong in that position, in the clade that they are seen in, since a high percentage of total iterations pointed to the same result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of history, this range is older than the Himalayan mountain chain and has a large influence on the biophysical and ecological processes over the entire peninsula of India, and even abroad. The vegetation and forest ecosystems in the Western Ghats play a large role in the Indian monsoon patterns, and mediate and channel the tropical climate found here. In addition to this, by virtue of sheer size alone, they act as a physical barrier and intercept the monsoon winds that travel from south to west, every year in summer. Traditional climatology is often based on boundaries and barriers, which modulates factors like wind, water and air. Since the Western Ghats are on the elevated corner of the Deccan Plateau, it is that much more central to the climate patterns we observe. These Ghats are not actual mountains in the true sense, but rather a faulted edge of a plateau that has been upraised. They are denuded, not deformed, with ravines and canyons along the scrap that faces the Arabian sea, with valleys on the east.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the recent years, the focus on nature conservation efforts has increased rapidly. Biological diversity is recognized as a crucial parameter to monitor local, as well as global environmental and climatic changes. Along with this, since the Western Ghats are so diverse in range, topography and biogeography, they have been subjected to a variety of conservation efforts. These Ghats are home to multiple major Indian passes, such as the Goa Gap, which sits between Karnataka and Maharashtra; it is a climate-mediated ecological divide &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1111/jav.01278&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;. These gaps are dispersal barriers, which are key in often preventing organisms from relocating, serving as a mode through which speciation occurs, and diversity increases &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/causes-and-consequences-of-dispersal-in-plants-15927714/&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;. It is also the perfect microhabitat for a large range or organisms that are found here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of butterfly diversity, the Western Ghats harbour 330 species, including 37 that are endemic, and another 23 that are shared only with Sri Lanka. These butterfly species span across 166 genera and 5 families! The butterfly species richness was relatively high for the natural forests which had a larger amount of tree species. The numbers were highest for deciduous forests, and rather low for evergreen and semi-evergreen forests, followed by scrub/savanna. This could be because these forests lack their own distinctive species, and attract generalists, instead &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1007/bf02703397&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;. Though butterfly endemicity was found to be approximately 10% in this area &lt;a href=&quot;http://wgbis.ces.iisc.ernet.in/biodiversity/sahyadri_enews/newsletter/issue53/bibliography/115-a-brief-overview-of-the-western-ghats.PDF&quot;&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;, it is much less than other groups of organisms that are found here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evergreen forests had high alpha and beta diversity values, which is expected in view of the potential shared, wide-range species. Since it is peak monsoon-land, the vegetation and plant diversity here is mostly a product of seasonal rainfall, as opposed to the atmospheric temperature &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-010-2331-3_7&quot;&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt; – this plant diversity in turn affects the butterfly species found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this, and the hundreds of studies done in the past, it is clear that the Western Ghats in India, being a perfect example of non-equatorial tropical evergreen forest, is home to at least 325 globally threatened organisms &lt;a href=&quot;https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1342/&quot;&gt;[9]&lt;/a&gt;, spanning flora and fauna, both. In an era like this one, more work should go into taking care of this diversity, as opposed to getting rid of it. Biodiversity loss is just as big an issue as climate change, and they’re both intimately related. Both have to be taken care of, to avoid such precious landmarks from crossing their tipping point and being destroyed. The Western Ghats have played such a crucial role on the Indian Peninsula, and a lot of what the subcontinent is like now, can be attributed to this range.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Introduction</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Winged Guardians of the Snow Leopard Landscape</title><link href="/blog/2021/SnowLeopard/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Winged Guardians of the Snow Leopard Landscape" /><published>2021-05-12T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2021-05-12T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>/blog/2021/SnowLeopard</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2021/SnowLeopard/">&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, I have been working with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncf-india.org&quot;&gt;Nature Conservation Foundation&lt;/a&gt;’s High Altitude Program, on creating pheasant spatial distribution models using camera trap data.

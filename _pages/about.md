Hi! I'm a senior undergraduate student at Azim Premji University in India. I study Biology and Education, and am interested specifically in Cell and Developmental Biology, as well as parts of Ecology...

With labs in India still shut, I am currently working on eliciting the importance of pedigree trees in the context of clinical genetics, and also on pheasant spatial distribution modelling in the trans-Himalayan landscape, with the Nature Conservation Foundation.

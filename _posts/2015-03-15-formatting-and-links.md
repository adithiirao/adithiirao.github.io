title:  Shade Avoidance Syndrome - Do Plants Learn from Light?

description: We know that at the simplest level, plants have the ability to grow towards the light, but how do they do this? What environmental cues are they capable of sensing and what do they use this information for?

Competition for light is something that is often seen in plants, as light is a major limiting factor. In dense herbaceous forest communities, it is unreliable to depend on the erratic and patchy sunlight – this is especially true for understorey plants, because they are characteristically sheltered by the canopy. But yet, understorey plants exist – how? To overcome the aforementioned problem, plants have evolved a variety of different approaches to not only survive, but also thrive, in different light conditions. One of those ways is by avoiding or tolerating shade. Angiosperms, for instance, display an impressive array of shade-avoidance tactics, which is definitely one of the factors associated with their immense success [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3040.1997.d01-104.x).

Plants perceive light with their photoreceptors, which are essentially made of proteins (phytochromes) linked to chromophores, the part of the molecule that is responsible for colour. Phytochrome responds to two areas of the light spectrum – red wavelengths (~667nm) and far-red wavelengths (~730nm) [[2]](https://www.indefenseofplants.com/blog/2017/7/8/how-plants-perceive-light). Phytochromes are also present in two forms: there is $$\text{P}_{\text{r}}$$ (the inactive form) and $$\text{P}_{\text{fr}}$$ (the active form), which undergo interconversion, changing the shape of the chromophore. Red light converts $$\text{P}_{\text{r}}$$ to $$\text{P}_{\text{fr}}$$, which then goes on to trigger and induce genes. This fact allows us to tell whether the phytochrome is in its active or inactive form, depending on the ratio of far-red to red light reflecting off of/through leaves. If plants were exposed to red light, $$\text{P}_{\text{r}}$$ would be converted to $$\text{P}_{\text{fr}}$$, and the plant would absorb the red light quite strongly, with a peak around 650nm. However, once the red photons are absorbed, the pigment undergoes a conformational change to the $$\text{P}_{\text{fr}}$$ state. In this state, far-red light is absorbed more efficiently than red light, and there is a shift in peak absorbance (to about 720nm).

Shade avoidance responses are initiated by an environmental signal – the reduction of the red (R) to far-red (FR) radiation ratio. This tends to happen in crowded plant communities where every individual’s exposure to light is not uniform, since vegetation dramatically alters the spectral energy distribution of daylight [[3]](https://doi.org/10.1093/aob/mci165). Because of the sheer number of neighbours the amount of far-red and red light differs.

In their natural environments, plants show aggressive shade-avoidance. In response to low R:FR signals, many plant species rapidly increase their stem elongation growth rate (longer internodes and petioles), often, but not always, at the expense of leaves and other storage organs. Leaves tend to thin and reorient upwards at elevated angles (hyponasty), branching is reduced, and tendrils and other organs that are capable of longitudinal growth also show responses to this low R:FR. These responses to low R:FR is what is described by ‘syndrome’ – multiple symptoms caused by an underlying problem. If the shade persists and the plant is unable to out-compete other vegetation, flowering is accelerated, to speed up fertilization and ensure reproductive success [[3]](https://doi.org/10.1093/aob/mci165).

By using these shade-avoidance tactics, the plant is able to increase its chances of survival. Elevating the leaves and other photosynthesizing structures to unfiltered daylight is therefore proving to be an effective strategy in rapidly growing plant populations [[3]](https://doi.org/10.1093/aob/mci165).

description: A potential use of accidental camera-trap sightings in ecology and conservation

Over the past year, I have been working with the [Nature Conservation Foundation](https://www.ncf-india.org )'s High Altitude Program, on creating pheasant spatial distribution models using camera trap data. The camera traps are an extremely useful resource in the acquisition of long term data, which is otherwise quite scarce. This kind of data, collected over the span of many years, is useful to monitor changes over time and even aids in conservation efforts (especially in harsh terrain where traditional methods of surveying become difficult).

Despite being set up for snow leopard monitoring, the cameras capture many other species, as well. My work involves pheasants, the elusive birds of the Himalayas. I wrote a brief article about it for the Snow Leopard Trust, which can be found [here](https://snowleopard.org/winged-guardians-of-the-mountains/).
